# CS2 Randomizer!

Do you think that Counter-Strike 2 is BORING? Do you need some **THRILLS** in your tactical shooter experience?
Would you like your weapon choice to be FULLY RNG-based? do you want every bomb carrier, amount of armor and defuse kit to be completely out of your hands?
Do you love GAMBLING??????

## Look no further, this is ***THE*** CS2 plugin for YOU!

With CS2 randomizer, you can turn your Counter-Strike 2 experience into a team-versus-team slot machine!
Simply install the plugin, and invite your friends over for a game of ~~suffering~~ PURE THRILLS!

With such killer features as
 - A random weapon for every player, every round! Will you get an AK-47 or a zeus? Who knows!
 - Random Bombs and defuse kits! Every Terrorist gets to do a coin-flip for a bomb and every CT gets to gamble for a defuser!
 - Random grenades will give you between zero and four randomly picked grenades every round!
 - Random armor means you either have nothing, a vest or all that and a helmet!
